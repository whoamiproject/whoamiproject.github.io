      content: Think of it as a <strong>Big Wall</strong> you can use to show <strong>Who You Are</strong>. Put all the posts that best represent <strong>You</strong> from multiple sources, including social media. The Wall expands as you drag your post horizontally or vertically. You can post directly on to whoami as well.

      headline: Update Your Wall
      content: Remember. It's all about showing others <strong>Who You Are</strong>. If you just had a trip to Himalayas, if you find your 7 years old rock and roll Facebook post more relatable, or if you want to show less of entrepreneur <strong>You</strong> and boost parent <strong>You</strong>, update your Wall accordingly. If you want to reorganize posts <strong>Just Because</strong>, that's fine too. Don't worry about loosing any reactions of the posts.
